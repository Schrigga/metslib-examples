SUBSET SUM TUTORIAL
-------------------

This is a simple tutorial to quickly get started using METSlib. 

The sample problem that is solved in main-tut1.cc is the subset sum
problem.

A possible choice for the objective function is defined in
tut_model.hh. The tut_moves.hh and tut_neighborhoods.hh define a
possibile neighborhood.

Please read the comments in the code and ask your questions on the
mailing list.
