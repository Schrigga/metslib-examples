ATSP
====

This implements a very simple tabu search strategy solver for the
Asymmetric Traveling Salseperson Problem (ATSP for short). This is an
example to show how to link and use the METSlib library.

A sample problem in TSPLIB format in the data folder (see data/README
for details)

As usual you need to 

./configure && make

You'll also need a C++ compiler with TR1 extensions (like gcc4) and
the METSlib core installed on the system.

This sample uses the local_search algorithm and a combined 2-opt/3-opt
move neighborhood (using the provided mets::invert_subsequence). 

Bugs
---- 

The algorithm is usually better suited for symmetric TSP but the
reading routine currently supports ATSP instances only.

Hacking the code
----------------

src/

  main.cc - the atsp permutation problem is loaded and solved with
            tabu search

  tsp_model.hpp - a class representing solutions to the problem (with
                   a cost function)
