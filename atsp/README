ATSP
====

This implements a very simple tabu search strategy solver for the
Asymmetric Traveling Salseperson Problem (ATSP for short). This is an
example to show how to link and use the METSlib library.

A sample problem in TSPLIB format in the data folder (see data/README
for details)

As usual you need to 

./configure && make

You'll also need a C++ compiler with TR1 extensions (like gcc4) and
the METSlib core installed on the system.

Hacking the code
----------------

src/

  main.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with tabu
            search

  atsp_model.hpp - a class representing solutions to the problem (with
                   a cost function)


Happy hacking
