QAP
===

This implements a very simple tabu search strategy solver for the
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP for short). This is an example to
show how to link and use the METSlib library.

Some problems instances are given in QAPLIB format in the data folder
(see data/README for details)

As usual you need to 

./configure && make

You'll also need a C++ compiler with TR1 extensions (like gcc4) and
the METSlib core installed on the system.

Hacking the code
----------------

src/

  main_ls.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with
               Local Search

  main_rrls.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with
                 Random Restart Local Search

  main_ts.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with
               Tabu Search

  main_sa.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with
               Simulated Annealing

  main_its.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with
                Iterated Tabu Search

  qap_model.hpp - a class representing solutions to the problem (with
                  a cost function)
