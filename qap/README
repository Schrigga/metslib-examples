QAP
===

This implements a very simple tabu search strategy solver for the
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP for short). This is an example to
show how to link and use the METSlib library.

Some problems instances are given in QAPLIB format in the data folder
(see data/README for details)

As usual you need to 

./configure && make

You'll also need a C++ compiler with TR1 extensions (like gcc4) and
the METSlib core installed on the system.

Hacking the code
----------------

src/

  main.cc - the qap permutation problem is loaded and solved with tabu
            search

  qap_model.hpp - a class representing solutions to the problem (with
                  a cost function)

  qap_move.hpp - a simple swap move

  qap_neighborhood.hpp - a generator of a stochastic subset of the
                         neighborhood with n swap moves and m dual
                         swap moves (using mets::complex_mana_move to
                         compose two qap_move together)


Happy hacking
